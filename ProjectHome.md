**SQLite: The Manager** is a small tool created for managing SQLite databases.

The tool is written in C#, for the .net framework. The current version contains the following features:

  * Open and close SQLite Databases
  * View table contents in a GridView
  * Store BLOB values as a file
  * Execution of SQL queries

The [FastColoredTextBox](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/161871/Fast-Colored-TextBox-for-syntax-highlighting) is used for SQL syntax highlighting.
The [System.Data.SQLite](http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/) library is used to provide access to SQLite.
Icons used are taken from the [Tango  Icon Library](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Gallery).
